# Digital RX8E M8357R
This is a 74xx clone of the Digital RX8E M8357 RX01 / RX02 floppy controller
for the DEC PDP8/E family computers. It's called the RX8E M8357R.

There are no DEC or SP chips used. Only 74xx and 74HCTxx series chips are used.
It passes the DIRXAC maindec and boots OS/8.

My goal is to use two of these boards in a PDP8/e. One at address 75 and one at 76.
In this way a RX01/RX02 emulator can be connected to the first boot device. 
It is quite fast because there is no seek time. A real RX01/RX02 drive can be connected
to the second controller. But you can use it in anyway you want off course.

I hope to do some more redesigns of several Omnibus boards. Prices are getting insane
and in this way you can build as many boards as you want to have. If you want to built these
boards and sell them on Ebay, you are more then welcome to do that. In this way you can help
other people to get these boards which probably are not able to solder them by them self.

All documents are profided as-is. I have to check which lisence is the best suitable for the project.

Regards, Roland
